Week 2 focuses on building a strong foundation in System-on-Chip (SoC) concepts while providing hands-on experience in functional modeling using the BabySoC project and simulation tools.

### Conceptual Overview

The first part of the task requires reviewing material on SoC fundamentals. Learners are expected to:

- Understand what a System-on-Chip (SoC) is and its typical components, including CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects.
- Learn why BabySoC serves as a simplified and practical model for mastering SoC principles.
- Recognize the purpose and significance of functional modeling prior to RTL (Register Transfer Level) and physical design steps.

### Hands-on Functional Modelling

The second part consists of laboratory exercises aimed at practical application:

- Learners follow VSDBabySoC project labs to install and use Icarus Verilog (for compiling Verilog code) and GTKWave (for waveform visualization).
- Key steps include cloning the BabySoC repository, compiling Verilog modules, simulating them to produce waveform files (.vcd), and analyzing reset, clocking, and dataflow within GTKWave.
- Documentation involves capturing simulation logs, screenshots highlighting correct module behavior, and brief explanations of each waveform.

By completing these labs, learners gain direct proficiency in simulating and investigating digital circuit behavior with BabySoC, supporting both theoretical and practical skill development in SoC design.
